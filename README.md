# verifiable-bandwidth-sampling

**Abstract**. Decentralized data hosting is blocked by the ability to 
guarantee speed of access. We propose a mechanism called verifiable 
bandwidth sampling, wherein a node samples another node's speed for 
solving a continuous off-chain data availability challenge. The challenge 
is designed to fit within the timekeeping of a verifiable clock - a 
blockchain consensus protocol. And in doing so, the bandwidth of a 
connection is securely measured. Building upon this result, we can design 
an automated market maker for data hosting (storage and bandwidth) which 
can scale horizontally in capacity.
